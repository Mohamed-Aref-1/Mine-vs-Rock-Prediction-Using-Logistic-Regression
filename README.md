# Mine-vs-Rock-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
The "Mine vs Rock" project uses logistic regression to classify sonar signals as mines or rocks. It involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The accuracy of the model is assessed, and a confusion matrix is generated for visualization.


# Documentation: "Mine vs Rock" Project
The "Mine vs Rock" project is a machine learning project that focuses on classifying sonar signals as either a mine or a rock. This documentation provides an overview of the project, its implementation, and key components.

# Project Overview:
Goal: Classify sonar signals as mines or rocks.
Approach: Logistic regression model.
Dataset: Sonar data.
Programming Language: Python.
Libraries Used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn.
Implementation Steps:
Importing Libraries: The necessary libraries for data processing, model training, and evaluation are imported.

# Data Collection and Processing:

The sonar data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
The dataset's shape (rows and columns) is determined.
Descriptive statistics of the data are generated.
The distribution of mines and rocks in the dataset is examined.
Data Preparation:

The data is divided into features (x) and labels (y).
The dataset is split into training and test sets using stratified sampling.
Model Training:

A logistic regression model is created.
The model is trained on the training data using the fit() method.
Model Evaluation:

The accuracy score is calculated for both the training and test data.
A sample input data point is provided to predict its class (mine or rock).
Confusion Matrix:

A confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's performance.
The matrix shows true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics are calculated and displayed.
Results and Conclusion:
The logistic regression model achieves a certain accuracy score on both training and test data.
The model's predictions on sample input data indicate whether it represents a mine or a rock.
The confusion matrix provides a comprehensive view of the model's performance.
Based on the evaluation metrics, the model can effectively classify sonar signals as mines or rocks.
Future Improvements:
Explore other machine learning algorithms for potential performance improvements.
Perform feature engineering to enhance model accuracy.
Incorporate cross-validation techniques for more robust evaluation.
Conduct hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
